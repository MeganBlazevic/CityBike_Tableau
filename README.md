# Module 18 | CityBike_Tableau Challenge 

## Background
As a new anaylist I am responsibile for overseeing the New York Citi Bike program.  I am asked to generate reports for New York City officials who are looking to market and improve the largest bike-share program in the country. 
The bike program has a ton of monthly data - but we have not created a true dashboard to view consistent informaiton (that is my goal for my second project as the analysist). My first project is to create a Tableau Story to show the success and potential opporuntities to the city officials.  

### Programs Used
- Python was used to combine my monthly data sets
- Tableau to create my story board

### Data Sets
I had the opporuntity to pick which datasets I wanted to use.  At first I was going to use 2021 and 2022.  Then I decided to look specifically had June (the start of summer) to see what the differences are. I contimplated using a 5 year range, but settled on 3 years (2018, 2019, 2020) which was important as you had the covid epidemic during this time frame which may have adjusted bike usage.

## Map and 
Create a map to show where all the various bike stations are across New York City. The map has the median age demographic interlayed in the map detail. This will show how the new bike stations are trending in the younger age population. 

## Visualizations
Create different visualizations to share the data with the city officials. Each visualiation will show a different discovery. Visualizations were created; combined into dashboards and then added to the story board in Tableau.

## Tableau Story
Using the story creation to tell the data story for the New York City Bike program for the officials.  Displaying data in a progression to walk through the program strengths and poential opporuntities for additional growth.

## Analysis
Analysis is done throughout the storyboard and within this read me. The analysis needs to be easy to read, as not everyone is used to working iwth this data on a daily basis.
